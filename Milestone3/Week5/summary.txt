Week 5 introduced miscellaneous security checks.  
The module scanned for common sensitive files (e.g., config.php, robots.txt)  
and checked for missing security headers.  
Testing on DVWA identified accessible files and missing headers,  
highlighting misconfigurations and weak security practices.
