Week 4 focused on Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) testing. 
We developed a script that injects XSS payloads into input fields and URL parameters. 
The script checks for payload reflection in responses, helping us identify vulnerable points. 
Testing was demonstrated on DVWA, showing how malicious scripts could be executed.
