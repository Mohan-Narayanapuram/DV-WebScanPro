Week 3 focused on SQL Injection testing. 
We developed a script that automatically injects SQL payloads into input fields and URL parameters. 
The script analyzes responses for errors or unusual patterns that indicate vulnerabilities. 
Testing was conducted on DVWA, where potential injection points were detected.
