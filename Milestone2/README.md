# Milestone 2: SQL Injection and XSS Testing

This milestone focused on identifying and testing for common web application vulnerabilities:  
SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

## Week 3: SQL Injection Testing Module
- Implemented a Python-based SQL injection tester.
- Injected crafted SQL payloads into forms and URL parameters.
- Analyzed responses for anomalies or error patterns.
- Identified potential injection points and suggested fixes (e.g., parameterized queries).
- Tested on DVWA and validated detection.

## Week 4: XSS Testing Module
- Implemented a Python-based XSS tester.
- Injected XSS payloads into detected forms and parameters.
- Analyzed reflected outputs in server responses.
- Demonstrated execution of payloads on DVWA.
- Highlighted prevention strategies like input validation and output encoding.
