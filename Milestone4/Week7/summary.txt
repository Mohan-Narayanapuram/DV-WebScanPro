Week 7 focused on building an automated report generator.  
We created an HTML report template using Jinja2,  
with severity color coding and charts for vulnerability distribution.  
The report aggregates results from SQLi, XSS, Misc, and IDOR modules into a single file.  
Testing confirmed that reports were generated successfully and could be viewed in a browser.
